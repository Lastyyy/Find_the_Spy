- If chosen Spy's level is 5 and he attacks the Spy with level from 1 to 5 - 
if the attacked Spy has a 5 level Spy in a neighbourhood (diagonally as well) 
then Player loses his 5 lv Spy, doesn't get any points and revealed card hides again.
If there is no 5 lv Spy in a neighbourhood, previous rules apply.
